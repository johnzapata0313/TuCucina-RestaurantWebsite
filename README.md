This project is a modern restaurant website designed to help local Philadelphia Latino-owned businesses strengthen their online presence. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site features a clean, responsive layout that highlights the restaurantâ€™s story, menu, and culture. Created as part of my freelance work, the project focuses on accessibility, mobile optimization, and authentic branding to help small businesses connect with their community and attract new customers.
